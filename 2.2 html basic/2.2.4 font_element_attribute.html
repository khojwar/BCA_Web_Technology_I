    <!-- 
    The <font> element was traditionally used to change text color, size, and font family. However, it's deprecated in HTML5, and modern CSS should be used instead.

        Attributes:
        color: Defines the color of the text.
        size: Specifies the size of the text.
        face: Specifies the font family. 
    -->

    <!-- Example of the outdated usage of the <font> element: -->
    <font color="red" size="4" face="Arial">This is old-fashioned formatting.</font>


    <!-- However, itâ€™s better to use CSS for text formatting today: -->
    <p style="color: red; font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;">This is modern formatting.</p>
    
</body>
